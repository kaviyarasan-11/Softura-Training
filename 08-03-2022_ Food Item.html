<p style="font-size:18px">Butter chicken originated from Northern India in 1948. Created by <mark>Kundan Lal Gujral</mark>, you may notice that Butter Chicken (known as murgh makhani — chicken with butter), is similar to British tikka masala. Prepared in a buttery gravy with the addition of cream gives the curry sauce a silky smooth rich texture.

<p style="font-size:15px">India is more than butter chicken, let’s begin with that. Every region in the country has its own flavors and ingredients that add nuances to different micro-cuisines, and each cuisine has its own history and legacy. As famous as Indian cuisine is internationally, it is generalized with a few dishes, but the thousands of recipes from Kashmir to Kanyakumari would make an impossible-to-lift cookbook.

With that established, let’s talk about one of the dishes that has crossed boundaries to become a staple in Indian restaurants all over the world: tomato-based, reddish-orange, creamy butter chicken. Believe it or not, it was the second most searched Indian dish globally last year, with 400,000 searches in a month. And why not? It’s so versatile!

Traditionally complemented by naans, it is now added to pasta, on pizza as a topping, in rolls, in pies, in pulao, and it has also replaced potatoes as fillings in samosas. Puritans will say the best way to eat it is as intended by its creators, but its evolution has brought forth crossovers with different cuisines and made it even more popular.
